# My 3D Job Portfolio

**3D Job Portfolio Summary**

Welcome to my **3D Job Portfolio** – a uniquely immersive and visually engaging alternative to the traditional resume. This portfolio is designed not just to inform but to *demonstrate* my work and capabilities in a much more interactive and pleasant way than a static CV. Instead of scrolling through a plain list of accomplishments, you’ll explore my experience, creativity, and technical expertise through an intuitive, project-centric environment that reflects who I am and how I work.

At the core of this portfolio is a deep commitment to hands-on **security research** and software development. One standout example is **Hashcheck**, a custom-built password hash detection and cracking utility. Designed for speed and modularity, Hashcheck intelligently identifies hash types and supplies optimized cracking parameters to tools like Hashcat. It also supports wordlist customization through JSON configuration, offering both power and flexibility. The project showcases not just technical proficiency in C++, but also an understanding of secure systems and practical penetration testing workflows.

In addition to Hashcheck, the portfolio includes several other **security-related tools and research artifacts**, including codebases built for port scanning, session management, and network enumeration. These projects not only reflect my grasp of cybersecurity fundamentals, but also demonstrate my ability to write clean, scalable, and purpose-driven code for real-world use cases.

But this portfolio isn’t limited to just code. You’ll also find a curated collection of **Job Interview Question Banks** that I’ve built over time – detailed repositories that compile frequently asked questions across a wide range of topics like software engineering, computer forensics, networking, and system design. These resources reflect my commitment to not only continuous learning but also to helping others prepare for technical interviews.

Rather than offering a flat resume filled with buzzwords and timelines, this portfolio gives a **multi-dimensional, narrative-driven showcase** of my work. It captures the depth and variety of my experience while keeping everything accessible and visually compelling. From backend infrastructure to interview prep resources, from security tooling to human-centered design—this is a living document of who I am as a professional and a creator.

Thank you for visiting my 3D Job Portfolio. I hope this format gives you a clearer, dynamic sense of my skills and interest for technology.
